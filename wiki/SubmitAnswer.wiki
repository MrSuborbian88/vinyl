|| Description: || The SubmitAnswer use case models a Student submitting the answer to a question via the Online Test interface. ||
||Actor(s)|| Student||
||Preconditions: || 1. Student must be successfully logged in via the LogIn use case. ||
||               || 2. The Student must have completed the appropriate steps in the TakeTest use case. ||
||Flow of Events: ||1. The use case starts when the Student navigates to the question they desire to answer.  ||
||                ||2. The system will display the question in a specific format. ||
||                ||3. The Student does the necessary work to compute the answer, and then enters it depending on the format. ||
||                ||3.1 For Multiple-choice/True-False questions, the Student must select at least one radio button to submit an answer. ||
||                ||3.2 For other questions, or combination questions, the Student must enter text in the appropriate fields. ||
||                ||4. The Student selects "Submit" when the answer is prepared: ||
||                ||4.1 If the student has omitted a certain portion or not-filled it out properly, an appropriate error message will be displayed.  Return to step 3. ||
||                ||4.2 If the test is equipped with a feedback/correction system, and the Student has not run out of chances, appropriate feedback is given to the student.  Return to step 3. ||
||                ||4.3 If the student is out of submission chances or the submitted answer is verified to be correct, an appropriate message is displayed.  This completes the use case. ||
||Post Condition:|| 1. The system will output that the question is closed and/or correct.  The Online Test will continue as outlined in the TakeTest use case. ||
