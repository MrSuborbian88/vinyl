<h1>Extend enrollment for all</h1>
<p>This page allows you to extend or restrict the enrollment period by the same amount for all selected course participants. The new enrollment period is calculated based on a starting reference date and the extended period selected.</p>
<p>Possible starting reference dates are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Course start date</li>
<li>Enrollment Started</li>
<li>Enrollment Ends</li>
<li>Today (this option in available only if the course start date has passed)</li>
<li>Course enrollment start date - the enrollment start date from the course settings page (this option is available only for courses with an enrollment start date set)</li>
<li>Course enrollment end date - the enrollment end date from the course settings page (this option is available only for courses with an enrollment end date set)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the extended period is set to 'Unlimited', then the starting reference date is ignored.</p>
