<h1>Group Enrollment Key</h1>

<p>Enrollment keys allow users to enroll themselves into a course, usually there is one key for the whole course defined in the course settings.  However, if you define a *group* enrollment key then not only will entering that key let the user into the course, but it will also automatically make them a member of this group.</p>
